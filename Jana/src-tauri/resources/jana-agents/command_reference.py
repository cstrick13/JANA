## 📌 Notes

- **Up ports** indicate active physical links and connections.
- Most interfaces are **administratively enabled** but in a `down` state, awaiting a connected device.
- **Ports 1/1/25–28** show "No XCVR installed", meaning no transceivers are physically present.
- **vlan1** is a virtual interface (SVI) used for in-band management.

> **Note**: All interfaces except `1/1/1` show zero traffic, indicating no link activity.

---

## 📌 Notes

- **RX/TX Bytes**: Useful for bandwidth monitoring and performance tracking.
- **Drops**: Persistent RX or TX drops may indicate congestion or misconfigurations.
- **Broadcast/Multicast**: Helps analyze network flooding or control traffic patterns.
- **Pause Frames**: If non-zero, could indicate flow-control activation due to congestion.
- Consistent zeros across interfaces (except active ones) is normal when no devices are connected.


# 📘 Command: `show interface utilization`

Displays real-time interface bandwidth utilization metrics, including RX/TX Mbps, packets per second (KPkts/s), and utilization percentage.

---

## 🔍 Output Overview

This command provides utilization statistics per interface, updated over a defined interval:

- **RX/TX Mbps**: Data throughput in megabits per second
- **RX/TX KPkts/s**: Packets received/transmitted per second (in thousands)
- **Util%**: Interface utilization percentage
- **Interval**: Sampling interval for stats collection (in seconds)
- **Description**: Interface description (if configured)

> **Note**: All interfaces show `0.00` for all values, indicating no active traffic at the time of polling.

---

## 📌 Notes

- **Interval** is typically set to `300` seconds by default.
- This command is helpful for:
  - **Identifying high-utilization ports**
  - **Monitoring real-time usage trends**
  - **Capacity planning and troubleshooting congestion**
- Persistent `0.00` values typically mean no link or no traffic on the interface.

All ports show `0` for traffic, errors, and drops, indicating no devices are connected or transmitting data.

---

## 📌 Notes

- **Active Ports**: Only interface `1/1/1` is currently active and carrying traffic.
- **Down Ports**: Interfaces `1/1/2–1/1/5` are up administratively but waiting for physical link.
- **MAC addresses** are unique for each port and used for Layer 2 communication.
- **Error counters** (CRC, collisions, etc.) are all zero, indicating healthy physical layer status.

> This command is valuable for **real-time interface diagnostics**, **bandwidth utilization**, and **traffic type visibility**.


# 📘 Command: `show ip dns`

Displays the DNS configuration for the switch, including VRF settings, DNS mode, and configured name servers.

---

## 🔍 Output Overview

This command provides information about:

- **VRF context** used for DNS resolution
- **DNS mode** (e.g., static or dynamic)
- **Configured name server(s)**
- **Host configuration status**
- **Static host-to-IP mappings** (if any are configured)

---

## 🧠 Example Output

| Field               | Value       |
|---------------------|-------------|
| VRF Name            | default     |
| Mode                | static      |
| Name Server(s)      | 8.8.8.8     |
| Host Configuration  | Active      |
| Host Entries        | None        |

---

## 📌 Notes

- The switch is using **Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8)** for name resolution.
- **Static mode** indicates DNS servers were manually configured.
- No custom **host-to-IP mappings** are present at the time of this command output.
- VRF `default` is being used, which means DNS lookups occur in the main routing table.

# Switch Functions

## Change DNS

#### User
> config  
> ip dns server-address [SERVER-ADDRESS]  
> write memory

#### JANA
> config/nip dns server-address [SERVER-ADDRESS]/nwrite memory

#### Use Case
- Changing the DNS server address is necessary when the network's DNS provider changes, or when switching to a custom DNS server for improved performance, security, or content filtering.
- This command is useful for troubleshooting DNS-related issues by temporarily pointing to a different DNS server.
- It can also be used to enforce organizational policies by redirecting DNS queries to a specific server for monitoring or compliance purposes.
- In disaster recovery scenarios, this command allows quick redirection to backup DNS servers to maintain network functionality.

#### Use Case
- Used to verify network connectivity between the switch and a target host.
- Helps diagnose basic network issues such as unreachable destinations, DNS resolution failures, or routing problems.
- Can be used to test response time (latency) and packet loss between the switch and the destination.
- Common in troubleshooting scenarios, such as confirming internet access or connectivity to internal servers.
